For coach Raheem Morris and offensive coordinator Zac Robinson, who saw Stafford up close during their time as Los Angeles Rams assistants, that created a strong incentive to make Penix the No. 8 overall pick in the 2004 draft even though the team already had invested heavily in free agent quarterback Kirk Cousins."
