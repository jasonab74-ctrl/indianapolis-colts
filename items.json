Thielen had just eight catches for 69 yards for the Vikings (4-8) this year and was a healthy scratch for their game at Seattle on Sunday, a 26-0 loss that was their first shutout in 18 years.  With the Vikings struggling badly on offense, Thielen was rarely used behind the top three wide receivers Justin Jefferson, Jordan Addison and Jalen Nailor."
