The Texans (11-5) extended their winning streak to eight games with the 20-16 victory to join their 2018 team, the 1992 Chargers, 1995 Lions, and 1998 Bills as the only teams since 1990 to lose their first three games and advance to the playoffs.  It’s Houston’s third straight trip to the playoffs, which is a franchise record and coach DeMeco Ryans and quarterback C.J. Stroud are the fourth coach/QB duo in NFL history to advance to the postseason in each of their first three seasons."
